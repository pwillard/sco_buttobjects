Python Script - inspiration from a tool we had in 3DC - sorely needed in Blender.

This Blender addon provides tools for aligning Selected Objects to the bounds of the Active Object, the 3D Cursor, or the Origin of the Active Object. Users can align along the X, Y, or Z axis and choose to align to the Minimum, Center, or Maximum bounds, with options for Inside or Outside alignment. When "Align to Object Origin" is selected, additional tools allow copying the Active Object's Scale and Rotation to the Selected Objects. The addon also includes a Distribute function, enabling users to evenly space selected Objects along the X, Y, or Z axis when three or more Objects are selected. The addon is accessible in the Item tab of the 3D Viewport Sidebar, offering a streamlined interface for precise alignment, distribution, and property transfer.
